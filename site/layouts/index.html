<div>
<h4>What did you think of our service during the time you used it?</h4>
<p> I enjoyed it, I wanted to deploy several gen tools, I got 1 click happy I must admit.</p>
</div>

<div>
<h4>Tell about how you made your site and why you chose the tools you did.</h4>
<p>I picked Hugo because it was the first one that I read about. I used the 1 click methond, connected to my github account. I then copied and paste the questions. </p>
</div>

<div>
<h4>Briefly explain a challenge you experienced in setting up this site and how you solved it.</h4>
<p>I first created a repo in my github account and then tried to deploy the gen tool. I encountered a few issues with that. I took a second approach by deploying the gen tool by using the one-click method which that process then created the master repo and deployed the code base. The only way I got around my road block was by trial and error.</p>
